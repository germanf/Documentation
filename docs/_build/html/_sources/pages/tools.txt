.. _msc_createtx:

msc_createtx.py
---------------

Purpose:
^^^^^^^^
Used to create, sign and/or send a Masterprotocol currency transaction

Checks:
^^^^^^^

Checks from address to make sure it has:

* Enough BTC to create/send the transaction

  * Note: To avoid potential double spends all unspent TX used to create a new TX are tracked/locked for 10 Blocks from use. It is recommended, when offline signing, to make sure you broadcast within this timeframe.

* Balance of the CurrencyID to make sure it has enough to send msc_send_amt

  * Balance is checked using 2 online resources (Masterchest.info and Omniwallet)

Inputs:
^^^^^^^
Takes json input via STDIN for the following variables:

* transaction_from: The Public Address of the Sender
* transaction_to: The Public address of the Receipiant
* currency_id: Currency ID to send. 1 for MSC, 2 for TMSC
* property_type: 1 for indivisible currency, 2 for divisible (MSC/TMSC are 2, Maidsafecoins are 1)
* send_amt: The amount of the Currency ID to send
* from_private_key: Base58 Private Key of the sender's Public Address ``*``

  * (Note: Should start with the number 5)

* broadcast: Create, Sign and/or Broadcast Tx.

  * 0 - Create the Unsigned TX file only
  * 1 - Create and Sign the TX file 
  * 2 - Create, Sign and Broadcast the TX file

* clean: Clean up any of the tx files created.``*``

  * 0 - Keep all Tx files created
  * 1 - Remove only the intersigned Tx files. (Leaves the original unsigned Tx and the signed Tx)
  * 2 - Remove all unsigned Tx files. Leaves only the signed Tx file that can be broadcast.
  * 3 - Remove all Tx files. Signed and unsigned, make sure you have broadcast the Tx before you do this.

* ``*`` Only required if you are signing/broadcasting the tx file and can be omitted if just creating unsigned file.*

The json takes the following format::

        {
          "transaction_from": "{{Public from Address}}",
          "transaction_to": "{{Public to Address}}",
          "currency_id": {{1 for MSC, 2 for TMSC}},
          "send_amt": {{amount to send}},
          "property_type": {{1 for indivisible currency, 2 for divisible (MSC/TMSC are 2, Maidsafecoins are 1)}}
          "broadcast": {{1 to create and broadcast or 0 to just create}},
          "from_private_key": "{{private key for signing}}",
          "clean": {{0 -keep all tx files, 1 -remove intersigned tx, 2 -remove all unsigned, 3 -remove all}}
        }

*Note: for security the following was a brand new empty wallet. You should replace it's details with your own applicable info*::

        {
